    "Transfer learning is the process of transferring learned features from one application to another. It is a commonly used training technique where you use a model trained on one task and re-train to use it on a different task. \n",

    "## What is Deformable DETR (D-DETR)?\n",
    "\n",
    "[D-DETR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.04159) is a state of the art transformer-based object detection model. D-DETR does not use heuristics based methods like NMS or IOU assignment found in convolution-based object detection models like Faster RCNN. Unlike DETR, D-DETR uses deformable self-attention which is more efficient compared to native self-attention.\n",

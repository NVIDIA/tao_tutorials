    "# Change Detection (Segmentation) using TAO Visual ChangeNet-Segmentation Network\n",
    "\n",
    "Transfer learning is the process of transferring learned features from one application to another. It is a commonly used training technique where you use a model trained on one task and re-train to use it on a different task. \n",
    "\n",
    "Train Adapt Optimize (TAO) Toolkit  is a simple and easy-to-use Python based AI toolkit for taking purpose-built AI models and customizing them with users' own data.\n",

    "## What is a Visual ChangeNet Network?\n",
    "\n",
    "Visual ChangeNet is a state of the art transformer-based Change Detection model. Similar to the optical inspection notebook, Visual ChangeNet is also based on Siamese Network, which is a class of neural network architectures containing two or more identical subnetworks. The training algorithm works by updating the parameters across all the sub-networks in tandem. In TAO, Visual ChangeNet supports two images as input where the end goal is to either classify or segment the change between the \"golden or reference\" image and the \"test\" image. TAO supports the [FAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.12451) backbone network for both Visual ChangeNet architectures. For more details about training FAN backbones, please refer to the Classification pytorch notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "TAO Toolkit versions 5.3 and later support some of the foundational models for change detection (classification and segmentation). NV-DINOv2 can now be used as the backbone for the Visual ChangeNet-Classification and Segmentation models.\n",
    "\n",
    "To mitigate the inferiror performance of a standard vision transformer (ViT) on dense prediction tasks, TAO supports the ViT-Adapter architecture. This allows a powerful ViT that has learned rich semantic representations from a large corpus of data to achieve comparable performance to vision-specific transformers on dense preidiction tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "In TAO, two different types of Change Detection networks are supported: Visual ChangeNet-Segmentation and Visual ChangeNet-Classification intended for Segmentation and Classification of change between the two input images, respectively. Visual ChangeNet-Segmentation is specifically intended for segmentation change detection. In this notebook, we leverage the Visual ChangeNet-Segmentation model to demonstrate change detection by segmenting the changed pixels between the two input images. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Sample inference from the Visual ChangeNet-Segmentation model\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a sample inference output for the Visual ChangeNet-Segmentation model. The model takes in two input images (test and golden reference) and outputs a segmentation change map for building change detection on LEVIR-CD dataset.\n",

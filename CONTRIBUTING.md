# How to Contribute

We'd love to receive your patches and contributions. Please keep your PRs as draft until such time that you would like us to review them.

## Test

Install system dependencies:

[just](https://just.systems/man/en/pre-built-binaries.html#pre-built-binaries)

```shell
uv tool install -U rust-just
```

Run linting and formatting:

```shell
just lint
```

This will also run auto-fixes and linting. We recommend that you commit your changes first.

Run all tests:

```shell
just test-level-<level>
```

Test levels:

0. Smoke tests. Requires >=1 GPU.
1. Partial E2E tests. Requires >= 8 GPUs.
2. Full E2E tests. Requires >= 8 GPUs.

Test outputs are saved to `outputs/pytest/<test_name>`. To monitor a test, open `console.log`/`debug.log`.

To see what tests are currently running and their output directories:

```shell
ps -aux | grep pytest
```

List all tests:

```shell
just test-list
```

Run a single test:

```shell
just test-single <test_name> [--pdb]

# Example
just test-single "tests/assets_test.py::test_inference_assets[base]"
```

To see all available commands, run

```shell
just
```

## Code Reviews

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult
[GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) for more information on using pull requests.

## Signing Your Work

* We require that all contributors "sign-off" on their commits. This certifies that the contribution is your original work, or you have rights to submit it under the same license, or a compatible license.

  * Any contribution which contains commits that are not Signed-Off will not be accepted.

* To sign off on a commit you simply use the `--signoff` (or `-s`) option when committing your changes:
  ```bash
  $ git commit -s -m "Add cool feature."
  ```
  This will append the following to your commit message:
  ```
  Signed-off-by: Your Name <your@email.com>
  ```
